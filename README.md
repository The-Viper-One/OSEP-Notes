# OSEP-Notes

This repository contains notes, ideas, and experiments for various techniques and tactics relevant to Offensive Security's OSEP (Offensive Security Experienced Pentester) certification. The goal is to explore and refine advanced attack methodologies, particularly those involving process manipulation, shellcode injection, and evasion techniques.

## Macro Phishing Reminders
- Is the payload we are using x86?
- Are we communicating on a well known port?
- Have we tested in a dev environment first?
- Is the macro attached to the document (not global templates?)
## Good checklist

## CyberChef PowerShell -> Base64

- https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Encode_text('UTF-16LE%20(1200)')To_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D')&input=d2hvYW1p

## PowerShell to C# Conversion

- **Dynamic Invocation in PowerShell and C#**: Ensure the correct use of `.MakeRefByType()` for any types that require referencing so the value is correctly reflected back to the function.
